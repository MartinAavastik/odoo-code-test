Odoo Code Test
==============


This module is meant to be introduction to odoo and assess your skills.
There are multiple TODOs in this code that must be solved. They are numbered and its reccommended
that you go through them sequentially but not required. You can ignore some of them if you can't find solution.

Tasks itself are not that hard, but this really tests how well you can find yourself in foreign code base / framework.
One tasks requires you to refactor existing code, so that should be easy if you know python code style standard.

What this module covers
- ORM
	- How to create fields, Edit existing fields from modules, Compute fields? Stored fields? Onchange? One2many,Many2many operators?
